ðŸ”­ I'm a self-taught software developer, with a keen interest in the functional programming paradigm.

ðŸŒ± Currently focusing on personal projects and professional development!

Here are some of my projects:

* [**libf**](https://github.com/yurixander/libf): A functional data structures and algorithms library written in TypeScript. The goal is for it to serve as a basis or foundations for my functional programming projects. It consists of functional & immutable implementations of essential data structures, such as hash maps, stacks, linked lists, and more. Furthermore, I have also implemented advanced concepts such as a custom effect system (with the help of JavaScript's `throw`), iterators, and monads.
* [**note-taking-app**](https://github.com/yurixander/note-taking-app): A skeleton application that I developed for use volunteer use.
